# Tonotopy

In many sensory regions of the brain, neurons that respond to similar features in their receptive fields are often arranged in close proximity to one another. A well-known example of this feature-to-place mapping is retinotopy in the visual cortex.
Our focus is on a similar organizational principle in the auditory system, specifically tonotopy. This refers to the systematic arrangement of neurons in the auditory cortex and other parts of the auditory pathway that are most responsive to specific sound frequencies.
